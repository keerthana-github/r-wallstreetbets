Exit the system|0|l6uhhn|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uhhn/exit_the_system/|47|1611862235.0|"The CEO of NASDAQ pushed to halt trading “to give investors a chance to recalibrate their positions [https://mobile.twitter.com/Mediaite/status/1354504710695362563](https://mobile.twitter.com/Mediaite/status/1354504710695362563) Now SEC is investigating, brokers are disallowing buying more calls. This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a “well shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?” We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didn’t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that can’t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I don’t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one."|2021-01-28 21:30:35

The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future.

THIS IS THE MOMENT|405|l6ub9l|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ub9l/this_is_the_moment/|178|1611861571.0|"Life isn't fair. My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.The game is the game. Always.Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face. And may the wings of destiny carry you aloft, to dance with the stars.GME@everything BB@everything🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"|2021-01-28 21:19:31

"We need to keep this movement going, we all can make history!"|222|l6uao1|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6uao1/we_need_to_keep_this_movement_going_we_all_can/|70|1611861505.0|" I believe right now is one of those rare opportunities that we all can help and do good. Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions. I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear. Just my 2 cents!"|2021-01-28 21:18:25
